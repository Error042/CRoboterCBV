# CRoboterCBV
A simple program for learning the C programming language in vocational school.

The subject was to build a 'robot' who will be set in a room and walk at the walls in a circle.
This version should be realized in a call by value fashon.
I builded mine a little bit more complex. Mine can do following things:

- can now walk from anywhere in the room and not only when placed at a wall
- after the measuring the robot will paint the room in the console with ASCII
- robot walks back after getting 4 measurements

Still room for optimization:
- there the walking back part is probably too long and could be shortened
